raspin is a GUI frontend for controlling the GPIO pins on a Raspberry Pi. It's
written in C++ and is based on QT.

Important: This is designed to run on a Raspberry Pi. Running this on any other
device could have unpredictable results.


BUILDING

The included build.xml uses the build tool ant with cpptasks. To build this, make sure ant and
cpptasks are installed ("apt-get install ant-contrib-cpptasks" should suffice) and run "ant" 
from the project root directory.

Alternatively, you can build this with a command like:

g++ -I/usr/include/qt4 -I./include -lQtCore -lQtGui -o raspin src/*.cpp

If compiled with ant (successfully), you should have a build/raspin binary.


DEPENDENCIES

raspin depends on Qt and gpio-admin:
