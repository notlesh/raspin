raspin is a GUI frontend for controlling the GPIO pins on a Raspberry Pi. It's
written in C++ and is based on QT.

Important: This is designed to run on a Raspberry Pi. Running this on any other
device could have unpredictable results.


DEPENDENCIES

raspin depends on qt. on ubuntu (etc) you can get this by:

sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install qt3-dev-tools qt4-dev-tools

if you would like to build with ant, you'll need some other stuff:

sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install ant ant-contrib-cpptasks openjdk-6-jdk openjdk-6-jre

raspin depends on Qt and gpio-admin:

and, of course, you'll need git to check out:

sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install git git-core


BUILDING

The included build.xml uses the build tool ant with cpptasks. To build this,
make sure ant and cpptasks are installed ("apt-get install ant-contrib-cpptasks"
should suffice) and run "ant" from the project root directory.

Alternatively, you can build this with a command like:

g++ -std=c++0x -I/usr/include/qt4 -I./include -lQtCore -lQtGui -o raspin src/*.cpp

If compiled with ant (successfully), you should have a build/raspin binary.
